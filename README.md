const opinion = " Embrace the challenge of the unknown, for what we perceive as 'hard' is merely a lack of familiarity. With a willingness to learn and persevere, we can conquer any task. In this vast universe, nothing is truly difficult, only the boundaries we create within our own minds. Break free from comfort and push through the barriers of perceived difficulty "
const unpopularOpinion = () => console.log(opinion)

unpopularOpinion()
