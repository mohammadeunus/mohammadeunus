## 😎 What I do currently?

Right now I am exploring C# and developing my problem-solving skills to pursue a career in .NET development.

## 🧨 What do I use to get the job done ?

* React
* Testing library
* Seed
* Design Systems
* My brain to think about problems deeply
* A positive mindset
* Hunger/desire (helps to ship small iterative chunks of work 🐐).

```
const opinion = " Challenges are an opportunity for growth and transformation. Instead of being intimidated by the unknown or the perceived difficulty of a task, we can approach it with curiosity and an open mind. By embracing challenges, we can shrink our comfort zones and develop new skills and perspectives "
const unpopularOpinion = () => console.log(opinion)

unpopularOpinion()
