## 😎 What I do currently?

Right now I am exploring C# and developing my problem-solving skills to pursue a career in .NET development.

## 🧨 What do I use to get the job done ?

* React
* Testing library
* Seed
* Design Systems
* My brain to think about problems deeply
* A positive mindset
* Hunger/desire (helps to ship small iterative chunks of work 🐐).

const opinion = " Embrace the challenge of the unknown, for what we perceive as 'hard' is merely a lack of familiarity. With a willingness to learn and persevere, we can conquer any task. In this vast universe, nothing is truly difficult, only the boundaries we create within our own minds. Break free from comfort and push through the barriers of perceived difficulty "
const unpopularOpinion = () => console.log(opinion)

unpopularOpinion()
